#Introduction


Seaweed assemblages are present in rocky shores around the world, creating very productive ecosystems of high ecological and economic importance. These assemblages include a variety of structuring species that provide habitat, food and shelter for organisms from different trophic levels, supporting complex trophic webs important both ecologically and economically.
The SWUAV project aims to develop innovative, reliable yet expeditious, imagery tools to map the intertidal and assess seaweed biomass available in the field, using remotely sensed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) images.
Developed in the scope of the SWUAV Project, the SWUAV_BIO tool is a free open-source QGIS plugin that allows to map and quantify seaweed biomass.
The development of this tool was based on initial exploratory surveys, for the selection of sites and methodologies, followed by the collection of spectral signatures for each type of objects to classify. Next, aerial imagery acquired with UAV equipped with RGB and multispectral sensors were used to develop a QGIS plugin suitable for assessing biomass remotely. Validation of the plugin has been performed by ground truthing in the field. Aerial images and seaweed percentage cover data collected in the field, allowed both the development and the validation of this new tool.
The SWUAV_BIO plugin enables rapid surveys of large extensions of coastal intertidal regions, supporting the launching of future expedite rocky shores monitoring programs. It is, therefore, a valuable tool for rapid mapping and quantifying seaweed biomass, which improves the ability to increase the knowledge about local ecosystems and contributes to the sustainable management and conservation of marine habitats.
This tutorial was created to help the user to understand and apply the SWUAV_BIO open-source application, developed with and for QGIS software.
